Contains the text of a book describing interesting examples of Python
programming for use in teaching.  An alternate title was "The Python
Teaching Cookbook".  The examples are written for Python 3 (3.2 was
used).

Requires Sphinx for formatting; once you have Sphinx installed, type
"make" to see the available targets in the Makefile.  "make html"
will create an HTML version of the book in the build/ directory.

I haven't tried finding a publisher for this book yet, and it may
just remain web-only.  Note that the license forbids publishing and
selling it, though you're certainly free to print copies for your
own private or educational use.
